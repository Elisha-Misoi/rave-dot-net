<h1>RAVE .NET SDK</h1>

Use this library to integrate your .NET app to Rave.

Begin by looking at the `ConfigModel` class and configuring your Secret and Public keys (remember not to add those to version control!!!). 
The value of the `Env` property of the `ConfigModel` (`LIVE` or `STAGING`) determines the `BaseUrl` or API endpoints used for your app.

Then you should populate a `PaymentRequestModel`. Edit this to contain all your request data however it comes. 

Next up is to implement Raveâ€™s integrity checksum flow into your app and here is where you get introduced to the `RaveService` class
which does all the heavy lifting for you. The `RaveService`'s `CreateChecksum()` method returns a lowercase hashed string
of all your `request` data (from your `PaymentRequestModel` and the keys you setup in your `ConfigModel`) and sorts it for you!
This is your `integrity_hash` and it is ready to be sent to your client page.

For making your calls, you can use either the `RenderHtml()` or `RequeryTransaction()` methods. 
`RenderHtml` redirects you to a modal where transactions can be made using your custom data from your request model, or in the case of a bad
integrity check, an error message pops up.

`RequeryTransaction` dumps the raw response from the developer for use as she sees fit.

It's that easy to use!
